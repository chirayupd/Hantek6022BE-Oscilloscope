## 4. Openhantek Python APIs

These python APIs can be used in Linux as well as Windows based systems. It eliminates almost all the limitations of the previously used software and enables the user to detect waveforms for longer duration of time, adjust the sampling rate, perform zero callibration and store the datapoints.

## 5. Standard 220V AC Supply

Here a system is designed using ZMPT101b micro-transformer based AC voltage sensor to measure the mains supply using the Hantek Oscilloscope. There is a microcontroller code to measure the RMS value of the AC mains as well.
