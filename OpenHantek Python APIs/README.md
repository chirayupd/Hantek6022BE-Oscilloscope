# Python APIs

This is a API for Python for the ultra-cheap, reasonably usable (and hackable) 6022 DSO, with a libusb implementation via libusb1 for Linux.

The scope can be accessed by instantiating an oscilloscope object. Things like voltage divisions and sampling rates can be set by the appropriate methods.

The APIs can be downloaded from the following github pages:
